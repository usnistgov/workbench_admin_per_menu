# workbench_admin_per_menu

##Synopsis

I am a module that provides Workbench access control for core drupal menus.

When enabled for specific roles via permissions, users will only be allowed to see, modify, and assign content to menus that are assigned to the same node of a taxonomy as they are via Workbench

This module only works with Workbench when Workbench is configured to use a taxonomy for content access.
